## Therapeutic Approach - Explain Like This

**Psychodynamic therapy** = Explores how past experiences and unconscious patterns influence current feelings and behaviors. Goes deeper than symptom relief.

**Mentalization-Based Treatment (MBT)** = Focuses on understanding your own and others' thoughts and feelings. Improves emotional regulation and relationships.

**Her style** = Warm, empathetic, non-judgmental. Creates safe space for deep self-exploration. Not advice-giving or directive - helps you discover your own insights.
